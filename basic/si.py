# Python3 program to find simple interest 
# for given principal amount, time and 
# rate of interest. 
  
# We can change values here for 
# different inputs 

P = 1000
R = 10
T = 5

# calculate the simple interest
SI = (P * T * R) / 100

# Print the resultant value of SI  
print('simple interest is ', SI)
